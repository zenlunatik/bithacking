# bithacking
Compiling a set of bithacking problems for reference.  

Some useful info:  

0110 + 0110 is equivalent to 0110 * 2 which is 0110 << 1.  

0100 * 0011 is equivalent to left shift by 2. Multiplying with a power of 2 is the same as left shifting by the power.  

To clear out the last n bits: x & (~0 << n)  
  
x ^ 0s = x  
x & 0s = 0  
x | 0s = x  
x ^ 1s = ~x  
x & 1s = x  
x | 1s = 1s  
x ^ x = 0  
x & x = x  
x | x = x  
  
get bit: (1 << i) & n  
set bit: (1 << i) | n  
clear bit: ~(1 << i) & n  
clear MS bits: ((1 << i) -1) & n  
clear LS bits:  (~((1 << i) -1)) & n 

Problem Set:  

1. You are given 2 32 bit numbers M and N and 2 bit positions i and j (j>i and j-i = number of bits in M). We need to replace bits i through j in N with M.  

2. Print the binary representation of a real number between 0 and 1. If the number is outside this range print error. If the binary representation is more than 32 bits, print error.
